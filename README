Usage:
<stream of words> | xargs whoozr.rb 

Output: (e.g.)
streptococc.us is available

Flaws: (notice I saved this for last)
It's hardcoded for the extensions to try. 
It needs a Gemfile to make loading the whois gem brainless. 
It should have a command line option to specify the list of TLDs to check. 
It should spawn N threads to speed up the search.
It needs tests?
